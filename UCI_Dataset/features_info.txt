Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial signals Acc-XYZ and Gyro-XYZ. 
These signals were captured at a constant rate of 100 Hz.

The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the "Euclidean norm". 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern and each of them is a tri-axial feature vector. Any feature with capital A means its Accelerometer sensor signal
and with capital G means, it is Gyroscope sensor signal.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'
